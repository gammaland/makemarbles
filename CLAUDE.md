# MakeMarbles

Local-first personal knowledge layer with two symmetric I/O channels: humans through a CLI, LLM agents through an MCP server. Notes live in a single SQLite file on the user's machine.

For the full picture of what is shipped, designed, or planned, see [`docs/SPEC.md`](./docs/SPEC.md). Per-decision rationale lives in [`docs/adr/`](./docs/adr/). This file is the entry-point summary, kept short on purpose.

## Tech stack (what is actually wired today)

- Python 3.12+, Typer, Rich, Pydantic, `sqlite-utils`, `python-ulid`, `prompt-toolkit`
- SQLite with FTS5 (Porter stemming, BM25, query escaping for special chars)
- FastMCP for the MCP server (stdio transport)

Dependencies that appear in `pyproject.toml` for v0.2 work (ONNX Runtime, `tokenizers`, NumPy) are scaffolded but not yet exercised at runtime; tests guard them with `pytest.importorskip`.

`worker/` (Cloudflare Durable Objects sync server) does not exist yet; it lands with Phase 2.

## Key commands

```bash
# Shipped (v0.1.0)
marbles log "content" [-t tag] [-e]   # capture; -e opens $EDITOR
marbles recent [--days N]             # browse
marbles search "query"                # FTS5 keyword search
marbles rm <id-prefix> [-y]           # delete
marbles count
marbles shell                         # interactive REPL

# Scaffolded for v0.2 (not fully wired)
marbles reembed [--model NAME] [--dry-run]   # --dry-run works; full path refuses cleanly

# Designed for v0.2 (not built)
marbles login | logout
marbles sync [--once] | sync status
marbles devices list | revoke <device-id>
```

All output commands support `--json` for scripting and agent use.

## Design principles

1. **Local-first**: SQLite is the source of truth. The sync server, when it ships, is an encrypted relay.
2. **Dual-channel I/O**: CLI for humans, MCP for LLM agents, single `core/` backing both.
3. **Append-mostly**: notes rarely update; the sync model leans into this with row-level last-write-wins.
4. **Zero-knowledge sync**: every op payload is encrypted client-side before it leaves the device. See `docs/SPEC.md` §7.
5. **No background daemon**: every command is short-lived. No watchers, no schedulers.

## Detailed design

- [`docs/SPEC.md`](./docs/SPEC.md): single source of truth for the system's current shape.
- [`docs/adr/`](./docs/adr/): per-decision records, including positioning (2026-06-03) and embedding model selection (2026-06-13).
